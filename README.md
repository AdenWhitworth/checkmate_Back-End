## Overview

**Checkmate** is an application that enables players to compete in real-time chess matches, communicate with opponents, and track their rankings. The backend, built with Node.js and WebSocket, manages all server-side logic, ensuring a smooth, responsive gameplay experience.

## Checkmate Demo

The Checkmate application is live and can be accessed here: [Checkmate Demo](https://checkmateplay.com). You can explore all features of the game, including real-time gameplay, chat, and rankings.

### Test User Credentials

Try out the app using the following demo accounts:

- **Emails:** demo1@gmail.com & demo2@gmail.com
- **Password:** PortfolioDemo1!

>**Note**: You can even play against yourself by opening the application in two separate browser windows.

## Features

- **WebSocket-Based Real-Time Gameplay**: Engage in real-time chess games with your friends using WebSocket-based updates for a seamless experience.
- **User Authentication & Authorization**: Handle secure login, registration, and user management with JWT-based authentication.
- **Matchmaking & Game Room Management**: Create, join, and manage game rooms, making it easy to start games with friends.
- **Player Stats & Ranking System**: Track player performance and compare ELO rankings with friends, updating results in real-time.
- **In-Game Chat Support**: Use real-time chat to communicate with your opponent during matches.
- **Game Persistence**: Stay in the game, even if you loose connection, with a reliable rejoin feature.

## Technologies Used

- **Node.js**: Backend runtime environment for executing JavaScript on the server.
- **TypeScript**: A strongly typed superset of JavaScript that enhances code quality and provides better tooling and type safety during development.
- **Express.js**: Web framework for building the RESTful API.
- **JWT (JSON Web Tokens)**: Used for secure authentication.
- **Socket.IO**: A library that facilitates real-time, bidirectional communication between clients and servers, crucial for features like live updates and notifications.
- **uuid.js**: A library used to generate unique identifiers (UUIDs), essential for creating distinct and secure references for users, games, and various entities in web applications.
- **Firebase**:
  - **Authentication**: Provides secure sign-in via various methods, including email/password, Google, etc.
  - **Admin**: Firebase Admin SDK is used for server-side operations like managing users, securely accessing Firebase databases, and performing other privileged tasks such as setting up custom claims for user roles and managing user accounts programmatically.

## Getting Started

Follow the instructions below to set up the project on your local machine.

### Firebase Setup Guide

1. Create a Firebase Project:
  - Go to Firebase Console and sign in with your Google account.
  - Click **Add Project** and follow the prompts.
2. Install Firebase in Your Project:
  - In your project folder, install the Firebase SDK via npm:
 ```bash
   npm install firebase-admin
   ```
3. Set up Firebase configuration variables in Your React App `.env`.
4. Set Up Firebase Authentication
  - In the Firebase Console, navigate to Firestore Database and create your database. Add collections for users, games, etc.
5. Set Up Firestore Database:
  -  In the Firebase Console, navigate to Firestore Database and create your database. Add collections for users, games, etc.

### Running the Backend

Once the environment variables are configured and dependencies are installed, you can start the server with:
```bash
npm start
```
This will run the server on the port specified in the .env file (default: 4000).

To run the server in development mode (with hot-reloading using nodemon), use:
```bash
npm run dev
```

## API WebSocket Endpoints

The backend provides a set of WebSocket endpoints to interact with the system in real-time:

- Game Routes
  - `/addUser`: Add a username to the socket connection.
  - `/createRoom`: Create a new game room.
  - `/joinRoom`: Join a game room.
  - `/opponentJoined`: Notify the opponent that youâ€™ve joined.
  - `/sendMove`: Send chess moves to the opponent.
  - `/recieveMove`: Recieve chess moves from the opponent.
  - `/playerForfeited`: Notify the other player of a forfeit.
  - `/closeRoom`: Close the room when the game is finished.
  - `/reconnectRoom`: Reconnect to an active game
- Chat Routes
  - `/sendGameMessage`: Send a chat message to the opponent during a game.
  - `/receiveGameMessage`: Recieve a chat message to the opponent during a game.
- Connection Routes
  - `/connect`: Establish a WebSocket connection for real-time game updates.
  - `/disconnect`: Disconnect from the WebSocket server.

## Database Structure

The application uses Firebase Firestore to store user data and game information. Below is the structure of the **users**, **players**, and **games** collections:

```json
{
  "users": {
    "$userID": {
      "email": "$email",                 // User's email
