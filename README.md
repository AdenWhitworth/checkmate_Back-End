## Technologies Used

- **Node.js**: Backend runtime environment for executing JavaScript on the server.
- **TypeScript**: A strongly typed superset of JavaScript that enhances code quality and provides better tooling and type safety during development.
- **Express.js**: Web framework for building the RESTful API.
- **JWT (JSON Web Tokens)**: Used for secure authentication.
- **Socket.IO**: A library that facilitates real-time, bidirectional communication between clients and servers, crucial for features like live updates and notifications.
- **uuid.js**: A library used to generate unique identifiers (UUIDs), essential for creating distinct and secure references for users, games, and various entities in web applications.
- **onnxruntime-node**:  A high-performance runtime for executing ONNX models in Node.js, enabling seamless integration of AI-powered features such as chess move predictions and strategic analysis into the backend.
- **Firebase**:
  - **Authentication**: Provides secure sign-in via various methods, including email/password, Google, etc.
  - **Admin**: Firebase Admin SDK is used for server-side operations like managing users, securely accessing Firebase databases, and performing other privileged tasks such as setting up custom claims for user roles and managing user accounts programmatically.

## Getting Started

Follow the instructions below to set up the project on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed:

- **Node.js** (v16 or higher)
- **npm** (v7 or higher)

### Running the Backend

Once the environment variables are configured and dependencies are installed, you can start the server with:
```bash
npm start
```
This will run the server on the port specified in the .env file (default: 4000).

To run the server in development mode (with hot-reloading using nodemon), use:
```bash
npm run dev
```

## Future Features

Here are a few exciting features that we are planning to add:

1. **Practice Puzzles**: Integrate Lichess puzzles to help players improve their timing and accuracy in critical chess positions, enhancing decision-making skills under pressure.
2. **Competition Timing**: Add a timer feature for each game to enhance competitive gameplay.
3. **Live Stream**: Enable real-time streaming of friends' games so you can watch matches live.
