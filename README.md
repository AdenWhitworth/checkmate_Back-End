  - Click **Add Project** and follow the prompts.
2. Install Firebase in Your Project:
  - In your project folder, install the Firebase SDK via npm:
 ```bash
   npm install firebase-admin
   ```
3. Set up Firebase configuration variables in Your React App `.env`.
4. Set Up Firebase Authentication
  - In the Firebase Console, navigate to Firestore Database and create your database. Add collections for users, games, etc.
5. Set Up Firestore Database:
  -  In the Firebase Console, navigate to Firestore Database and create your database. Add collections for users, games, etc.

### Running the Backend

Once the environment variables are configured and dependencies are installed, you can start the server with:
```bash
npm start
```
This will run the server on the port specified in the .env file (default: 4000).

To run the server in development mode (with hot-reloading using nodemon), use:
```bash
npm run dev
```

## Future Features

Here are a few exciting features that we are planning to add:

1. **Social Platform**: Connect with friends and build your chess network. Features will include a friends list to challenge specific players, a private game feed to view completed games and puzzles, and activity updates to celebrate your friends' progress.
2. **Competition Timing**: Enhance gameplay with advanced timer options, such as classic chess clocks, time increments per move, and blitz-style controls for fast-paced matches.
3. **Live Stream**: Watch friends' games live with real-time updates. Future enhancements may include features like game highlights, real-time commentary, or reactions to key moves.
4. **Game Evaluations**: Analyze completed games move by move to identify strengths and mistakes. Features will include engine-powered AI insights, color-coded move evaluations (great moves, inaccuracies, blunders), and suggestions for improvement to help players sharpen their skills.
